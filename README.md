2) have unoccupied ports "5432" and "5000" (both depends on current configuration of the application)
3) build the application using command "docker-compose build" using docker-compose.yml file within flask-demo directory
4) start the application using command "docker-compose up" using docker-compose.yml file within flask-demo directory
